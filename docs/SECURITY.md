## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Telegram X** relies on [TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib) for most security-critical operations (encryption, key management, etc).

When reporting a vulnerability, clarify whether it affects TDLib or Telegram X, and go to Settings — hold app version — `Copy Report Details`, and include the copied text in your report, if it represents the last affected version.

Refer to [Telegram Bug Bounty Program](https://core.telegram.org/bug-bounty) for more information.
